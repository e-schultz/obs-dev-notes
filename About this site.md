# About this site

So today, after talking with someone that will be on-boarding to my team soon as a junior developer - and we have been talking about where they are at as a developer, what they know, what they don't know, etc.

There  is a lot to dig into, and they have been asking some great questions - and a bit about making the transition from working in Data Science, to becoming a developer. 

They were asking about [[Software Architecture]], curious about the libraries, tools and frameworks we use and why, has some knowledge of [[Design Patterns]] like the [[Repository Pattern]], but is wanting to dive in more.

So, I thought this could be a good starting point to start a public knowledge base of resources, concepts, links, mini-articles, etc.
