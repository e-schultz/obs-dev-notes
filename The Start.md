# This Is Just the Beginning 

To understand what this site is about, have a quick read of [[About this site]]

As I figure out how I am going to organize and label things, some starting points:

- [[Advice For New Programmers]]
- [[202011261805 ELI5 - Repo|ELI5 - What is a Repository?]]

Also trying to move some of my old blog posts over into here, and see how I can link things up.

- [[Are Your Unit Tests Failing for the Expected Reasons]]

And also taking some of my longer tweet-threads, and cleaning them up a bit more - with mini-posts on

- [[Don't underestimate the value of working on a legacy codebase]]
- [[Interviewing for Learning]]
