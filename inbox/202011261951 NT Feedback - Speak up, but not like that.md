Giving feedback is hard, giving good feedback is even harder - and even some of the best intended feedback, can impact people in ways that you don't expect.

Having recently done a round of performance and feedback reviews - the topic of feedback has been on my mind quite a bit. 

__From__

>- What are some common feedback mistakes
>- What is some common feedback that is actually unhelpful?
>- What type of feedback is ablest? 

One bit of feedback that I have been given in the past, and also feedback that I am sure I've given before is that _you should really speak up  more_

At first glance, not a problem - but lets consider a bit more what we are looking for here. 

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You really should speak up more.

There can be a number of reasons why someone may not be speaking up more at work, and the advice can come off as being very non-specific, and you might not always get the results that you expect.

- üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You really should speak up more.
- üö´ Too much information, too fast, stop interrupting. Speak up more just, not like that. 

For me, I am [[Neurodiverse]] - ADHD, possibly ASD, and also have a Stutter - at times getting words out can be a little bit difficult for me.


### Too much, Too fast,  can you try speaking NeuroTypical?

Then when the words do come out, hello rapid-fire wall of information, have I told you everything about my special interest and way more information than you could possibly want to know on the topic?

ADHD Impacts executive function, and with impulse control - it can be hard to not interrupt at times, or maybe something earlier in the conversation got my attention, and I end up giving a long response to that even though the conversation has moved on.

Is it really that you want me to speak up more? or that you value my ideas and want to hear them, and what does it mean to be heard?

> Something to consider is - why doesn't someone speak up more?

### Some reasons for me. 

####  1. Group Size

if a group gets to be too large, I can't keep up with the conversations, especially if it's a few side conversations.

I can end up paying attention to everything all at once, but nothing at the same time.

A good meeting facilitator can be a big help. 

#### 2. Not enough time to process the information / question

Very often meetings will present a bunch of information, and then want 

- feedback 
-  opinions 
-  answers
-  updates, etc

Being able to spend. few minutes preparing for a meeting can really help with the impact of context shifting.

I usually need time to go over things on my own, even if just to gain context before the meeting. 

Getting asked for feedback or ideas on the spot for something that I just saw for the first time: 

- üß† - my brain is probably going to enter buffer mode
- üëÑ- my mouth will say "sounds good, no questions" 
	

#### 3. Stuttering can make it hard

### üí° What are some ways to help?

Some stuff I've tried / kinda works for me. 

Both as mix of what I try and do for myself, but also for others.

__Your mileage may vary, and interested in what works for other people.__ 

### 1.  Use zoom reactions

### 2.  Zoom chat / Back channel chat

Simply type your comment into the chat, especially if it's a fast moving conversation.

if there's an "any questions" - you've already written it down.

Keep an eye on the chat to know to give the person a chance to talk to you their point more. 

### 3.  Turn off the camera 

I've noticed this both for myself, and with others - sometimes turning off the camera helps me be more engaged in the meeting, and end up speaking up more. 

### 4.  Try a live transcription app 

I've been using [[Otter.ai]] [link](https://otter.ai/login) - and it's been a big help.

- offloads alot of effort of note taking
- easier to be engaged
- if I get distracted - I can read  and catch up 
- can comment in line to get back to later 
	
### 5.  Provide information beforehand 

at least know what the topic of the meeting is about.

Agenda, any documents, slides, anything for  context before hand.

Even if it's a reoccurring meeting, put in the invite:

> "expected to review critical issue list before meeting" 
	
Don't just assume that since it's the monthly critical review meeting that people are going to know:

- to review them before the meeting, - know where to  find them 
- what type of info they should have 

put that detail in the invite. 

### 6.  Separate Discussion vs Decision meetings 

Are we here to talk about something and gather information, or are we here to make a choice?

If possible - Separate the two. 

### 7.  Post meeting follow-up

If someone seemed quiet during the meeting, I might follow up with them a little later - and maybe with some more open ended questions instead of just "any thoughts/feedback" 

I know how often it can be hours after a meeting (usually on a long walk after work) I have a flood to "oh yeah this is what I wanted to say"

So with that in mind - getting better and writing those down and sending them after some editing 

But, also encouraging people to provide feedback in that way if it works better for them.
