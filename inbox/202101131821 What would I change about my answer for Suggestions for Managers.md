In 2018, I was profiled by VentureOut - [Venture Out Profile: Evan Schultz on Programing & Being “Out” At Work](https://medium.com/venture-out/venture-out-profile-evan-schultz-a4fdfd79c7f3), and while I still agree with much of what I say in this profile - when it comes to the question

**VO: What is one thing managers or those in leadership positions can do to make their teams / workplaces more inclusive?**

The answer that I gave is a start - but I would change, and expand on it now that I am a manager. 

>**ES:** If giving back to the community and charitable causes is part of your company’s culture, include charities and organizations that focus on LGBTQ+ issues. Get involved with your city’s local Pride — and have your own Pride events in the office.
>
 Seeing companies do that can help make people feel more comfortable knowing that they can be _out_ in a supportive environment.

## What would I change about this answer?

I think this answer is a good start - but if left here, it can lead to performative allyship, and "check-box" diversity, and more work needs to be done. 

Some things that I think I would expand on, is

### Don't offload the burden of education onto your employees

If you have employees that are part of a marginalized or minority group - you are not going to be aware of all of the different issues impacting them, what the possible triggers are, what matters to them and why. 

I've seen management and leadership before offload the burden of educating others onto the people that are the most impacted. 

If you have Queer, Trans, BIPOC employees - listen to them, what their concerns are - but make the time and effort to educate yourself, and do not expect them to do the heavy lifting for you. 

### Understand the Energy Tax of Showing Up

You do not need to understand all of the nuance of the issues that are impacting employees, but you can try and understand the emotional tax that is paid by showing up. 

You do not need to understand everything about being queer, trans, non-binary, ADHD, Autistic, Black, Indigenous or a Person of Color, but you can have empathy and try to understand the tax that is paid by simply showing up. 

A very simplified version of this, is assume everyone has 100 credits of energy to spend during the work day. 

If an employee is paying a tax of 50 credits simply to show up at work - and then every micro-aggression, etc keeps adding up - and they start paying interest on that tax. 

Compared to someone that is paying a tax of 10 to show up - both people are putting in 100% of their effort - but one of them is going to be getting ahead a little bit more. 

This goes back to not offloading the burden of education - as if someone is already paying 50 credits to show up, another 30 credits to play educator - that's leaving 20 credits left just to do their job. 

While we can't eliminate the tax that is paid outside of work - we can work to try and offset it, and create an environment where they don't need to worry about that as much.

### Believe Peoples Experiences

If someone comes to you with a problem, raises an issue, talks about an experience - believe them. 

Responding with things like

- that is so shocking
- I can't believe that happened to you
- Are you sure that really happened?

It is discounting their experience, and can turn into gaslighting your employees, and quickly erode trust. They can go from feeling like they belong, to feeling like they need to fit in - and start filtering these parts of themselves, adding to the tax that they need to pay to simply show  up.

### If it's not a problem for you - it doesn't mean it's not a problem for them

If an issue is raised and you don't fully understand it - don't dismiss it, let them know you will look into it, and aim to understand their perspective. 

For example - awhile ago I had someone come to me with concerns that a team member had the book 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Jordan Peterson on their desk. 

At the time - I didn't know as much about Jordan Peterson, and a book called 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - what's so wrong about that?

Instead of dismissing their concerns - I did some quick searching, while also considering the employee I was talking to - a trans employee - and it didn't take too long to find out Peterson's Transphobic views, and how he is a gate-way to the alt-right. 

It would have been easy to discount it as "It's just a book - whats the problem" - but would you have the same reaction if someone was casually reading Mein Kampf next to you? 

### Recognize Your Own Privilege

We all come from different places of privilege, and intersectionality - and privilege in itself is not a bad thing - it's how we use it.

I still encounter people all too often that will get defensive if you mention privilege, and respond with "but I worked hard for where I am" 

Kim Crayton does an excellent job at explaining Privilege in a way that really got through to me and started to shift my understanding, and would highly recommend watching these two talks.

- [Unintended Consequences: How to Reduce Exclusionary Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8F12gZJ4AQ)


### Follow Kim Crayton

Also - I'd say - follow Kim Crayton Twitter - https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1 - but also expect to hear the term "mediocre white dudes in tech" .. a lot. 

See who she re-tweets, and follow them (depending on why she's retweeting them of course) - and listen to the experiences of others. 

And listen - and avoid being the "reply guy" - "but not all men", "but not all white people", "but not all straight people" - you'll see lots of those people in the threads, and often their foot ends up in their mouths.
