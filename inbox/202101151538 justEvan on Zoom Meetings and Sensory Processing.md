Camera off and using an app to auto transcribe notes have been a big help for me. - Can read along if I need to. - If I get distracted - can quickly re-read to catch up. - knowing it's being captured I can be more engaged in other ways Helps, but isn't perfect.

- being able to highlight in real time 
- can add comments 
- add screen shots 
- I can go back and edit the transcript after, and it keeps in sync with the audio recording 

At times the transcript accuracy is a bit off, but if I edit to clean it up - it's like scrubbing my thoughts.

The combination of 
- reading 
- listening 
- then editing and correcting 

Helps alot to process / understand and remember.

I'll also take lots of screen shots and add them - good visual cues, and I find more useful than a video recording for me.

Being able to comment and add links to things like 

- slack threads 
- jira tickets 
- google docs 
- blogs / articles 
- my other notes

At times during a meeting I'll remember "oh yeah that thing" - quickly find a link to it, and add it to the transcript. It starts to build into a densely linked personal knowledge management system / map.

This combined with my other note taking methods - helps me find / surface information, and within the context that makes sense to me. Bookmarks are useless for me, as they tend to exist without context.

Having information and notes get (somewhat) naturally surfaced where I expect to find it vs needing to go searching for it all the time = one of the best things I started to do for myself in 2020.

The nature of remote work, especially in tech - information is stored /everywhere/ in so many different apps and tools. 

Off the top of my head, some of the things I need to check regularly.

- multiple jira boards 
- multiple trello boards 
- notion 
- Confluence 
- namely 
- office vibe 
- more Slack than I care for 
- google drive 
- email 
- figma 
- Miro 

and I'm probably missing a few

Trying to fit all of that into one tool often fails.

Trying to organize it in a way that makes sense for everyone is also difficult.

Collaborative notes / knowledge management / etc is important.

But dont undervalue the importance of building your own system.

Mine makes sense to me - but would overwhelm others. I use it as my working memory pretty much - that links to other systems. It's also the working draft of my information dumps - that I eventually clean up, and get into a shareable form for others.
