>Belonging actually isn’t about fitting in, which some of us mistakenly believe it to be—it’s about being accepted for who we are. [^1]


- Fitting in is how we alter our behavior to be accepted by a group, and we can often pay an energy-tax as we filter ourselves to fit in
- Belonging is being accepted for who we are

Ritu identifies the three selves

- The Performing Self - what we change, or mask to fit in
- Authentic Self - who you really are
- Adapted Self 

> The Adapted Self is who you are when you make a choice to change an aspect of your [behavior](https://ritubhasin.com/blog/want-to-change-your-life-focus-on-your-behavior), in order to meet your own needs or others’ needs. When you adapt, you’re not driven by fear – you’re driven by an authentic desire to change your behavior. Because you’re making a choice willingly, it feels good to do [^2]
