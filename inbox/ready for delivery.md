# What does Ready mean?

The Definition of Ready can vary by team, but generally speaking that the [[Z-User Story]] is well understood enough on

- what is going to be built
- how it's going to be built
- how much effort it should take 
- understand how to test it
- understand what done looks like

If there are too many unknowns, then that is when we might create a [[Spike]] because we don't know enough to deliver the story.
