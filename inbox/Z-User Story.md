# What is a User Story?

The goal of a user story, is to be able to deliver something of value to the user. 

Depending on where in the backlog the user story is - it may have different levels of detail. 

## Story Detail Level 

User stories that are going to be top priority - should have enough detail and information that the team knows how to deliver the story.

Stories that are lower in the backlog can have less detail, but should be revisited as part of [[z-backlog refinement]] as the sprints progress.

As the stories move towards the top of the backlog, ideally the team should 

- have had a chance to review the story a few times
- have been understand the requirements, how it's going to be tested, etc
- have a clear understanding of how it fits in with the rest of the backlog

## User Stories are a Starting Point

One of the goals of a healthy backlog, is to be able to maintain a steady stream of stories that we are able to deliver every sprint.

To do that, we need to have a shared understanding of the story, it's requirements, how it fits in with the rest of what we are building - but also how it's impacted by other projects or teams.

It's through this process of [[z-backlog refinement]] that we are able to break stories down into smaller pieces, and have them [[ready for delivery]]

Having user stories be broken down into smaller ones should be expected.

As the team better understands what is being built, and getting a sense of what the feature is, the acceptance criteria, etc - it can start to identify that maybe a story is trying to cover too much.
