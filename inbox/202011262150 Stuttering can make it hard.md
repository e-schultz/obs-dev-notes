In a fast moving conversation, it can be difficult to take part in it - especially if I'm getting stuck on the first word I want to say.

People may not notice I'm trying to speak, or they do and talk over me. 

Now and then someone will say the word for me - and then let me carry on - and I actually appreciate that.

But, if they say the word and then take over what I was saying - ðŸ¤¬ 

Stuttering can also make it really hard to join the conversation (and ADHD /ASD can make this worse)

If I'm trying to rearrange a sentence in my head so I can say it fluently, at
times the conversation has already moved on. 

**This can then lead to:**

- ðŸ§  have a whole lot to say after the fact.

in which case I l get "why didn't you say something sooner"

- ðŸ’­ I interrupt 

Which can annoy people not only due to the interruption, but it can also be moving back to a topic people thought we were done with.
