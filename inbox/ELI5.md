# The obvious isn't always simple

I've found that when I've been teaching or mentoring, that it is very easy to fall into the experts blind spot. 

When someone asks a question, and the answer seems obvious to you and you being by saying:

> If you just ..... and then boom - works

That "just" is likely a bunch of information that may need to be explained, 

## Experts Blindspot - You just should already know ....

There is a lot of assumed knowledge in "you just",  such as


_The Other Person:__
- Knows those details
- Understands them in the context of the current problem
- Understands them in the same way that you understand them 

So, the idea is to try and explain programming concepts like I'm five.
