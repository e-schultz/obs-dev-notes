# How Data Engineers relate to [[Data Scientist|Data Scientists]]

While Data Engineering has it's origins in Business Intelligence and Data Science, it is also closer to Software Engineering, as they are the ones building  build tools, infrastructure and frameworks [^1]

A key responsibility of a data engineer, is the "ability to design, build, and maintain data warehouses[^2]

Without having these data warehouses, other activities related to data science becomes too expensive or difficult to scale.

[[Data Engineer|Data Engineers]] make Data Scientists more productive [^3], by building solutions that prepare data that is ready for analysis, and for use by other consumers of data.
