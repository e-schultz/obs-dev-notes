[[ADHD]] - [[Neurodiverse]] -- [[neurodiverse tech]]
- Being #neurodiverse and also working in tech, now as an #manager - it's interesting to see how others work, ND and NT.
  - I do need to be mindful of not projecting my own experience onto others.
- But when I see things happen that may make someone else think that a person is being
  - lazy
  - careless
  - not paying attention to detail
  - unmotivated
  - not trying hard enough
  - My default tends to be - don't assume it's a fault of the person.
- I've been on the receiving end of comments like that all my life, and know how frustrating it is to be dismissed as lazy or careless - especially when I've put in so much effort, and tried to be extra carefull.
- Is it the team dynamics?
  - Unclear priorities?
  - Not sure where to start?
  - Unclear stories / requirements?
  - Has something been communicated from a NT loaded with assumptions that other people should "just get"
- Are they not comfortable asking for help / support / clarification because all through school and thier career having people getting frustrated with them for "not just getting it"
- Is there a mix of smaller bite sized work that can be picked off to help build momentum too go into the larger tasks?
- Did they Hyperfocus and get like 80% of it done A but now hitting Hyperfocus burnout / fatigue - and getting the last details done is proving to be near impossible - and what support can be provided.
- How do they process information - do they need time with something on thier own before discussing it in a larger setting?
- Context switching and multi-tasking is hard for most people, but can be especially disruptive for #neurodiverse people
  - are they getting enough heads down time?
  - Do they keep getting pulled in other directions?
  - has meeting overwhelm taken over?
- Do they do thier best work / focus at odd hours - but feel pressure to be "on" from 9-5?
  - Do they feel / know that they can have autonomy to pick up some other things - even if it's not top priority, but helps point them in that direction.
- Learning to become a good manager is hard, and it takes time - and still figuring things out.
  - But - I don't know many managers / leadership in tech that are ND, or if they are - are not public about it.
- It can be scary to be open about this at work - especially if not one above you is being open about it either.
  - It would be really nice to find other managers /leadership roles / C-suite / directors that are ND be more open about it.
- It's probably mean alot to the people working for you.
