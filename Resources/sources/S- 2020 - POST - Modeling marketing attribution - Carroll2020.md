- The attribution data model In reality, it’s impossible to know exactly why someone converted to being a customer. The best thing that we can do as analysts, is provide a pretty good guess. In order to do that, we’re going to use an approach called positional attribution. This means, essentially, that we’re going to weight the importance of various touches (customer interactions with a brand) based on their position (the order they occur in within the customer’s lifetime).To do this, we’re going to build a table that represents every “touch” that someone had before becoming a customer, and the channel that led to that touch. ^e89c50
