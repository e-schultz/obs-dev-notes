### Who do Data Engineers work with?
- Data analysts who answer specific questions about data, or build reports and visualizations so that other people can understand the data more easily.
- Data scientists who answer more complex questions than data analysts do. For example, a data scientist might build a model that predicts which customers are likely to purchase a specific item.
- Systems architects who are responsible for pulling data into the applications they build. For example, an e-commerce store might offer discounts depending on a userâ€™s purchase history, and the infrastructure for calculating that discount is built by a systems architect.
- Business leaders who need to understand what the data means and how others will use it.

### Data Engineering vs Data Science

==Data engineering and data science are complementary. Essentially, data engineering ensures that data scientists can look at data reliably and consistently.==

Data scientists use technologies such as machine learning and data mining. They also use tools like R, Python and SAS to analyze data in powerful ways. These technologies assume the data is ready for analysis and gathered together in one place. ==They communicate their insights using charts, graphs and visualization tools. Data scientists must be able to explain their results to technical and non-technical audiences.==

Data engineering uses tools like SQL and Python to make data ready for data scientists. Data engineering works with data scientists to understand their specific needs for a job. They build data pipelines that source and transform the data into the structures needed for analysis. These data pipelines must be well-engineered for performance and reliability. This requires a strong understanding of software engineering best practices. Data engineering also uses monitoring and logging to help ensure reliability. They must design for performance and scalability to work with large datasets and demanding SLAs.

==Data engineering makes data scientists more productive==. They allow data scientists to focus on what they do best: performing analysis. Without data engineering, data scientists spend the majority of their time preparing data for analysis. ^e61cff
