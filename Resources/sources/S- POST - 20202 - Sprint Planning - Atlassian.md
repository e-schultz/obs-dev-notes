### Highlights first exported December 3, 2020 at 8:36 PM
- Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team. ^1d0fef
- Bad sprint plans can derail the team by setting unrealistic expectations.
- The What –  The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal.
- The product owner must be prepared, combining the lessons from the previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback, and their vision for the product, so they set the scene for the sprint.
    - **Note:** maintaining a healthy backlog takes a lot of time and effort.
      When stories are being written 'just in time' - it can be hard to ensure that everything is lined up in the same direction.
- Focus on the outcomes not the work During sprint planning it is easy to get ‘bogged down’ in the work focusing on which task should come first, who should do it, and how long will it take.
    - **Note:** This can be a hard habit to break for most people, and something I can fall back into myself at times.
- Good estimation requires a trust-based environment where information is given freely, and assumptions are discussed in the pursuit of learning and improvement.
    - **Note:** When there hasn't been enough time to discuss a story and the team to review it, it's hard to estimate. 
      We might make assumptions - but not have the time to question them.
- and allow guardrails for self-organization
    - **Note:** teams can have a great deal of agency - I can help with some priorities, but it's more about pointing in the right direction. 
      I think I need to be more clear in that kind of messaging.
- But be careful planning too upfront.  Instead of building the most complete, “every minute of the sprint is accounted for” sprint plan, focus on the goal and build enough of a sprint backlog to get started
