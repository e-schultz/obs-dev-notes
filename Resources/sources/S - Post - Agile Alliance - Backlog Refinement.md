# Agile Alliance - [[z-backlog refinement]] Definition
Backlog refinement (formerly known as backlog grooming) is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are [[ready for delivery]]. This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity. Some of the activities that occur during this refinement of the backlog include:

- removing [user stories](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories) that no longer appear relevant
- creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
- re-assessing the relative priority of stories
- assigning estimates to stories which have yet to receive one
- correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information
- [splitting](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/split/) user stories which are high priority but too coarse grained to fit in an upcoming [iteration](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/iteration)
