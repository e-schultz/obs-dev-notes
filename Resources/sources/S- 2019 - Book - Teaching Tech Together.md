### Common Novice Misconceptions

-  **Factual errors** like believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia (it’s Victoria). These are usually simple to correct. ^71e2d3
- **Broken models** like believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction. We can address these by having novices reason through examples where their models give the wrong answer. ^fedcc9
- **Fundamental beliefs** such as “the world is only a few thousand years old” or “some kinds of people are just naturally better at programming than others” [^Guzd2015b],[^Pati2016]. These errors are often deeply connected to the learner’s social identity, so they resist evidence and rationalize contradictions.  ^fccd5a
