I,

I am [[Evan Schultz]], and [[I am not a robot]], which should seem obvious I hope, but I've been accused of otherwise before. 

I think this is going to be a bit of a weird mix of part journal, mini notes, stories about being [[queern in tech|queer]] and [[neurodiverse in tech]], and how I got here. 

I leave a big digital foot-print, and often [[tweet-thread]] stuff on twitter - at times mini journals, info dumps, trains of thought.

But, turning those into something more fleshed out - but, if your curious to get a short-cut to knowing me, check out my socials (lol I hate saying that) - but I talk about the things I care about, and also my experiences

My more creative side - have an instagram for random video art I make - [evan.just.evan](https://www.instagram.com/evan.just.evan/)

and [@evan.just.ev4n on tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@evan.just.ev4n?) - ranging from [stories of getting through school with a stutter](https://www.tiktok.com/@evan.just.ev4n/video/6918575339262184709?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) to well, [whatever this is](https://www.tiktok.com/@evan.just.ev4n/video/6917816231810616581?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)

But,

- I'm queer
- neurodiverse 
- work in tech 
- enjoy teaching
- vocal about issues I care about

I'm currently an [[Engineering Manager]] at [[PartnerStack]], before that I worked at [[Rangle]] for five years, and I wore so many hats there - and learned so many things. 

Before that, I worked at [[Procom]] - started there while I was finishing up my last year at Ryerson University.

One story I'd like to start with - is about [[my first real program]]
