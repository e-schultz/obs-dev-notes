# [[Remote Work]] as [[Neurodiverse]]

In some ways, working fully remote has been a sensory hell for me - especially the wall of zoom, and the constant awareness of being on camera. 

Early on - I would do what you would read in lots of "how to be professional on zoom" guides - of leaning in, making eye contact, being animated, etc. 

Eye contact for me can be uncomfortable, let alone when making it with a wall of people - and while trying to pay attention to the screen share, etc. 

The lack of movement was also difficult - when I worked in an office, even if it was a meeting heavy day - usually at least one of them would have been a walking meeting, not every meeting was sitting down.

Complicating things of course, is also the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown orders - access to so many of the tools that I've come to rely on for self managment, are all messed up.

It's a combination of sensory overload, but under stimulation at the same time
