# Am I?

I don't have an official diagnoses of Autism, although it is something I've talked with my therapist about, and the TL;DR is - "Probably, but not sure if it's worth the effort to get an assessment done"

There is a bit packaged up in that - both the difficulty and cost in getting the assessment, but also a "you've learned to mask well enough, and are doing fine"  

## Is it worth the effort?

On one hand, I have a relcutancy to self diagnose as Autistic, although I think I probably am - I totally understand why so many people do need to self diagnose - it's a pain in the ass to get, expensive, and has so many barriers to entry. 

As a 38yr old, well established in their career - doing pretty well for himself, is getting an official Dx really going to change anything?

## Sensory Seeking

Something interesting happened after the first time we talked about it.

I had been going through a pretty difficult time, I was taking [[mental health leave]] from Rangle, and it felt like all of my self-care, self-management, self-regulation tool-box had been thrown out the window. 

When going through some of the questions - he got really interested in a few around my sensory seeking behavior, and especially what I called [brain f u music] (https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1354488086462423048).

## The Reflection Loop

Anyways, when I got the "probably" - it's like something clicked in my head, and I could see parts of my life through a new lense - and like so much more of myself made sense.

I remember there would be days when I'd be trying to walk into work - and I'd get into these intense life-reflection loops, like replaying moments from my lie in high definition - remembering moments like when I was being [[yelled at by miss jackson]], down to hiding in the coat racks in the back of the classroom and entering shutdown mode. 

It'd be like doing a few weeks worth of psychotherapy self analysis in the span of a few minutes - and I would exhaust myself, walk back home and crash for the rest of the day.

It was really interesting - but also exhausting.

## Revisiting it Again

It's been a year or two since that first appointment, and also now well into the pandemic. I had bought it up again, because I was finding adjusting to remote work as ADHD / neurodivergent was really hard, and things like the [[wall of zoom are sensory hell]]. 

But similar thing - "Probably, and probably not worth the effort." *shrug*
