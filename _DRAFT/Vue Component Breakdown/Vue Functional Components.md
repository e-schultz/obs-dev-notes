One of the things that I like about Vue is the templating syntax,  it adds just enough sugar ontop of Vue to make the experience of writing markup for components really simple - without getting in your way too often.

One of the other things I like about Vue, is that it knows how to get out of the way and give you back control when you need to.

> Vue recommends using templates to build your HTML in the vast majority of cases. There are situations however, where you really need the full programmatic power of JavaScript. Thatâ€™s where you can use the render function, a closer-to-the-compiler alternative to templates. [^basics]

For example, one of the limitations of [[Vue Single File Components|Single File Components]]  is that you need to have a single root element.

# Multi Root Example
