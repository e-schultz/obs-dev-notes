Vuex is a [[state management pattern ]]+ library for [[[Vue]] applications.[^4]
 
Vuex serves as a centralized store - like a database, for all of the components within an application. [^4]

One of the challenges with state management in front end applications, is ensuring that state is mutated in a predictable fashion, and following the rules of Vuex - it helps ensure this predictability. [^4]
