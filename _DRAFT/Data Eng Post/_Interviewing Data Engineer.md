# Interviewing Data Engineer

Recently, where I work has posted a job opening for a Senior [[Data Engineer]] [job posting](https://jobs.lever.co/partnerstack/0cb878c6-f246-4112-b2f1-58bf112d1939)  [^jobposting] and while I have been interviewing software developers since my early 20s - this is the first time that I've had to interview for a Data Engineer. 

As I started to review candidates, trying to give feedback on who we should call, and eventually needing to interview them as the Hiring Manager - it dawned on me,

> I have no idea how to Interview a Data Engineer

I did know a few thigs:

- I knew the challenges we were facing 
- I knew what was in the job posting [job posting](https://jobs.lever.co/partnerstack/0cb878c6-f246-4112-b2f1-58bf112d1939)
- I _sorta_ knew what a Data Engineer was 
- I assumed I knew that me and my manager had the same expectations 

So, I figured I need to learn how to interview a Data Engineer, answer a few questions and also confirm a few assumptions.

## The Initial Questions

Instead of spinning in circles - I decided to write down a few questions as a starting point. 

- [[What is a Data Engineer]]?
- Who will they report to?
- What problems are we hoping they will be able to help us solve?
- What are our next generation of products and data initiatives?
- [[Who will they support]]?
- [[Who will they be working with]]?
- What are our data needs?
- Types of challenges and problems to solve?
- Misc - other job expectations
- [[What are we looking for]]?
- [[Do me and my Manager share the same expectations]]?

Some of these questions were in the job posting [^jobposting] , some required a bit of research, and a few conversations with my manager.
