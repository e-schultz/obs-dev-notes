## Rough Notes
- Data engineering and data science are complementary. Essentially, data engineering ensures that data scientists can look at data reliably and consistently.[^1]
- They communicate their insights using charts, graphs and visualization tools. Data scientists must be able to explain their results to technical and non-technical audiences.[^1]
- Data engineering makes data scientists more productive[^1]
