# What is a Data Engineer

I've worked in the tech industry for a long time, and had a pretty good sense of what a Data Engineer is, however - Data Science is an area that I haven't focused on, and thought that now would be a good time to google "What is a Data Engineer" - and take some notes.

## What was I hoping to learn?

- [[My understanding of Data Engineer vs Industry definition of Data Engineer]]
- [[Data Engineer vs Data Scientist]] 
- [[Data Engineer#Common Skills]]
- Types of problems they generally work with, and types of challenges they need to solve
- [[Data Engineer#Common Tools Used]]
- What are the use cases of those tools
- How do those skills and tools fit within my understanding of our Job Posting, and team needs?
