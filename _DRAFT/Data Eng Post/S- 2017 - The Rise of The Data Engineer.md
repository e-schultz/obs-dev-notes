# Highlights

> Unlike data scientists — and inspired by our more mature parent, software engineering — ==data engineers build tools, infrastructure, frameworks, and services==. In fact, it’s arguable that data engineering is much closer to software engineering than it is to a data science

> the data engineering field could be thought of as a superset of **business intelligence** and **data warehousing** that brings more elements from **software engineering**. This discipline also integrates specialization around the operation of so called “big data” distributed systems, along with concepts around the extended Hadoop ecosystem, stream processing, and in computation at scale.
