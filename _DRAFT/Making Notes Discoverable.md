My preoccupation with note-taking, has had me talking about notes at work recently.

a common theme I hear is:

- "I take a lot of notes, but I rarely read them"

and usually, the notes are stored in a Google Doc/Drive

Another trend I've noticed is along the lines of

- notes are in addition to the work
- notes are done after the fact
- notes are to capture ideas

Instead of 

- notes are how you work
- they are done while you are working
- they are done to generate ideas

For this to work - your notes need to be fluid and malleable and be something that can evolve over time. 

Something about a google document feels 'final' once you have written your report. 

It's then disconnected from the rest of your work.

Then usually - the document is only going to appear when you specifically go looking for it, and not have it appear where you expect it to be found.

Once you stop relying on folder structure and hierarchy to organize your notes, your notes become much more useful

When using note-taking apps that support [[back linking]], showing back-links, graphs, and also being able to filter / search/query on those backlinks - your notes start to appear where you need them.

For example, in my notes - I might write something like

- [ ]  [[Bob]] is #blocked  on [[TT-12345]]
   #followup

Later that day, I'll look over my notes for things tagged like 'followup', and either do them - or mark them as done.

I might change the note to then be

- [X] [[Bob]] is #unblocked on [[TT-12345]]
    #followedup with soandso and (link to slack thread)

and possibly copy/paste the slack thread text into the note

If during a meeting, I think of some feedback for someone, I'll write down 

- [ ] #[[feedback]] [[Alice]] -- (stuff)

I'll then give the feedback, make a note that I did,

Then when it comes time for doing reviews, being able to d a search on those tags is really helpful

I'll also tag things by quarter and week quite often, so lots of stuff is littered with #Q42020 #2020wk49

I tend to chunk things by weeks and quarters

being able to find all notes referencing [[The Incident]] in #Q42020  - is really handy.

hen when there is a writeup about [[The Incident]] - it can pull in references from all the other notes, but then that might be something that then gets copy-pasted into a google doc, or a jira ticket

People place too much value on the "Final Draft" of a document, and not enough value on all the notes taken along the way.

Keep the notes around.

They can become inputs to your other notes. 

For too long I'd toss those notes away and only hold onto the final copy.
