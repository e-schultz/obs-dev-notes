# [[_DAILY NOTES|ðŸ—“]]  So, tonight I guess is [[The Start]]  of this all.

I wonder what would be useful to keep on the daily pages like this.

A change log?
Fleeting notes?
Not sure.....

But I did start a seedling of a note - [[202011261805 ELI5 - Repo| ELI5 - Repo]], as a starting point to introduce the [[Repository Pattern]] - and explain the why behind it a bit, and also link to other resources/etc that might be useful.

So, I think maybe this could serve two purposes 

## The Tech

Programming concepts, resources, etc 

For example, this is still very much rough - but [[202011261805 ELI5 - Repo| ELI5 - Why is a Repository Pattern?]]

## Tech is People

We need to stop treating people as resources, commodities, plugs that can be easily replaceable. The idea of treating people as people should not be a radical idea, but sadly that is not always the case.

People skills are crucial for any engineer - even if you are staying on an individual contributor track, or looking to go into management or a leadership position. 

I'm currently an Engineering Manager now, and one of my motto's is

> I'm more interested in building the people that build the software

So I guess this can also be a spot for me to write about my thoughts on being a manager - and a Queer, Neurodiverse manager.

For example, what started as a tweet thread - but [[202011261951 NT Feedback - Speak up, but not like that|NT Feedback - Sepak up, but not like that]]
