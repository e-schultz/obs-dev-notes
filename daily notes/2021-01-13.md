# [[_DAILY NOTES|ðŸ—“]] Bright and Early - Inclusive Leadership Workshop 

Today, I attended the Bright & Early Inclusive Leadership workshop - and found it to be a very useful session. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are critical for companies - and being able to build up the skills needed for Inclusive Leadership is important. 

Before the course, there was a list of pre-reading that was recomended to do - that included a number of great articles.

One of the themes that came up, was the difference between [[202101131941 Fitting in vs Belonging|Fitting In vs Belonging]]

## Fitting In vs Belonging 

When talking about this section, it reminded me of when I was profiled in [Venture Out](ttps://medium.com/venture-out/venture-out-profile-evan-schultz-a4fdfd79c7f3) [^ventureout] on being out at work.

While I have been out for a long time, I spent much of my early career in the "cooperate closet", and I would spend a lot of time filtering myself - changing the pronouns of my partner, referring to him as a friend - simply answering what did I do for the weekend could become a minefield. 

I was staying in the closet so I could fit in, and it came at a cost.

While most of what I said in that profile I still agree with, one area that I'd update my answer on would be my advice to managers. 

It's something I've been meaning to expand on for awhile - but have an initial draft of my thoughts in [[202101131821 What would I change about my answer for Suggestions for Managers|What would I change about my answer for Suggestions for Managers]]
