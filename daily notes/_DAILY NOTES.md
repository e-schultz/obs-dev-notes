# About This Section

Daily Notes are the on-going 'daily log' / 'journal entry' type of writing. 

Stuff here tends to be rough, and may eventually get turned into permanent notes, longer posts, write-ups, etc.

It's basically my 'learnig in public' dumping ground.

Have a look at the bottom of this section for 'Pages that Link Here' to see all of the days I've written something.
