I've been having sensory / light sensitivity issues the past few weeks - which then leads to eye strain / fatigue / headaches / difficulty focusing.  

I've noticed that the last few weekends - I've been hanging out in my bedroom until the sun sets, and it feels like a weight is lifted from my head.  
  
Trying to push through this discomfort during the work week has not been good for me, so temporary expirement - moved my home office into my bedroom which gets more shade, and the light isn't as intense.  
  
  Only lunch - but my head / eyes feels so much better than the last few days of work.  
  Going to order some extra curtains that I can put up and reduce the light in my living room - as living out of my bedroom for 90% of the time doesn't seem like a healthy long term option either.
