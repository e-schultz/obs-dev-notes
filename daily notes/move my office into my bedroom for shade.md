Something that I've noticed over the last few weeks, and have even made a few tik-toks or tweet threads talking about it, is how I've noticed I've become really sensitive to light recently.

Something about the winter sun was really bothering me - and it felt like I had a constant pressure on my head that made it hard to focus during the day. I was starting to notice that on the weekends - I'd spend most of the day in my bedroom, and then move to the living room around 4/5pm once it started to get dark out.

The [[2021-01-28|other day]] when walking to my desk - I started to feel headachy and queasy, and almost thought about taking another day off of work. 

But, I decided to try moving my desk into my bedroom - to see if having more shade would help with the discomfort I've been having recently. 

I quickly busted out my measuring tape, ensure I had enough space - and then slid my standing desk over to my bedroom.
