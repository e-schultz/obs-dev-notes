# [[_DAILY NOTES|ðŸ—“]] Lets Talk 

Wrote a bit earlier today on being neurodiverse and a manager - and a bit of how it influences me, turned it into a tweet-thread - [[2021-01-28 - Neurodiverse Manager at Work| into a tweet-thread]]

Since the pandemic - I've found it really difficult to adjust to being ND while working, and have written/tweeted alot about my experiences of being neurodiverse in a remote world. 

I have [[my thread of my threads of ADHD]] - [tweet](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1291048872740102144) - some of them are rambles, some of them feel like a decent first draft of a longer post.

Something I've found interesting on twitter - is forcing myself to write in 150 character chunks helps organize my thoughts, and even when I'm near a laptop I'll tweet from my phone often - the slower typing also helps.

Another thing I've done recently is [[move my office into my bedroom for shade]]
